# üîç v0 Functionality Summary
# This version introduces foundational logic for intelligent variable and state extraction from spreadsheet-like cell data. The key features include:

# ‚úÖ Core Features
# Merged Area Detection: Automatically identifies the starting cell of a merged area containing the keyword "action".
# Header Name Identification: Extracts header names from cells, marking them as valid when they are not empty or reserved terms like "result".
# Line-by-Line Parsing: Each cell's content is processed line by line to extract all potential variable names and states.
# Finds concensus of names and states based on user input.
#
# üß† Extraction Logic
# The system uses a combination of rules and heuristics to identify variable names and states:
#   Hyphen-based parsing (e.g., Name - State)
#   Slash-separated state indicators (e.g., ON/OFF)
#   Keyword matching for known states (e.g., True, False, Lit, Occupied)
#   Transition word detection (e.g., goes, stays, moves)
#   Header-based inference: Uses header names to support state identification
#   Verification logic: Tracks and confirms extracted names and states when multiple candidates are found
# 
# ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations
# Header-based name extraction is not yet implemented
# Manual input prompts are currently disabled for streamlined automation
