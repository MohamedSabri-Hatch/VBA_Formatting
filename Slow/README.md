(EOS) Slow Slow v0 is the most updated and completed version of the code prior to Nicole's comments.
  - All v0 code files are tested updates to the code such as
      - v0.1 with an added column formatting function (doesn't work)
      - v0.2 is unmerging additional rows and resizing the rows to match merged height (mainly for top side of document format)
      - v0.3 replaces non capitalized codes with capitalized versions (ie. Tpmt --> TPMT)
  - v1 implements efficient row sizing
  - v2 code will focus on implementing column width changes
  - v3 fixes bolding
  - v4 add periods to the end of comment section
  - lets hope there's no v5
