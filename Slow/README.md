(EOS) Slow Slow v0 is the most updated and completed version of the code prior to Nicole's comments.
  - All v0 code files are tested updates to the code such as
      - v0.1 with an added column formatting function (doesn't work) :white_check_mark:
      - v0.2 is unmerging additional rows and resizing the rows to match merged height (mainly for top side of document format) &cross;
        - v0.2.x.y (x varies depending on 0.2 version) remove grey column at the end of the table &cross;
      - v0.3 replaces non capitalized codes with capitalized versions (ie. Tpmt --> TPMT) &cross;
  - v1 implements efficient row sizing :white_check_mark:
  - v2 code will focus on implementing column width changes :white_check_mark:
      - v2.x will be updated row sizing values to better fit with column width changes
  - v3 fixes header rows
      - v3.1 does a lot of things
        - implements efficient row sizing for inserted header columns too
        - removes added header rows
        - replaces them with properly formatted header rows
        - optimized page break search
      - v3.2 fixes initial header row height --> changed CleanUpHeaderMergedRows
      - v3.3 fixes bugs in header row height & fixed different background colours (set all to RGB 191, 191, 191)
  - v4 fixes bolding &cross;
      - v4.x fixes bolding in rows following greyed out rows &cross; ✅
      - v4.x.y fixes code bolding &cross;
          - v4.1.2 is what i had opened - ran fine still not recognizing shunted and recognizes () as a state
          - v4.1.3 is a functioning bolding wit TP and FP capitalization
              - v4.1.3.0.1 bolding is mostly good - added tp capitalization (doesn't work for headers for some reason) **THIS IS WRONG I JUST REALIZED BOLDING IS BROKEN**
                - Note - I noticed that even if previous state is Code 1,8 (Code 1,7) then next is (Code 1,7) it still didn't recognize it as same state so review logic behind it
              - v4.1.3.0.2 **BOLDING STILL BROKEN** added capitalization for fp
              - v4.1.3.1 is proper capitalization for FP and TP in header + body modularized
      - v4.2 fixed bolding and capitalization -- added comment case handling & **ADDED PERIODS TO COMMENT SECTION**
  - v5 remove last grey empty row &cross; ❎
  - v6 modularize everything into its own set of functions - main macro to be barebones calling on functions &cross;
